# LotR Clicky Game 🌋

https://daniblaney.github.io/LotRclickygame/

This is a memory game with React. This breaks up your application's UI into components, manages component state, and responds to user events.

* The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time.

* The user's score will reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

* Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.

* Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.

User trys to click through all 12 images without clicking the same image twice!

### Before You Begin

- You will need to `git clone` https://github.com/DaniBlaney/LotRclickygame.git the repository onto your own machine.

- Run `yarn install` while in the repository inside of your terminal/git bash. This will load of the necessary packages in order for your server to run error-free. This project relies on the following dependencies:

- Then run `yarn start` and visit `localhost:3000` in your browser.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
